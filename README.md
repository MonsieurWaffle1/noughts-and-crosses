## About

Hi there! Here you'll find the bridging work for joining the Computer Science course in 2025!

Your job is to make a simple machine learning algorithm that is able to play Naughts and Crosses. I've already created the game for you, you just need to make the AI. All the code is in the src folder, and there are some instructions that can be found in the engine and main scripts.

The idea is that your alorithm will at first make random and unwise moves, however you should be able to "train" it each game that you play, with it learning and adapting. I don't want a hard-coded solution, I want it to learn for itself.

You must not use generative AI to code this solution for you - I know AI code when I see it - however it can be a helpful resouce for debugging. 

This dosn't have to be perfect! I just want you to explore some options, have a go, and most importantly have some fun. Things are going to go wrong or be a little confusing, but I would encourage you to keep going - writing comments as you go might help others understand it and offer some help.

If there are any problems or if you need some help, send me an email at theotsmith@protonmail.com. I may be away so it might be a little while before you get a response.
